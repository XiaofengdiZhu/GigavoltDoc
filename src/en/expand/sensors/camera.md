# Camera <Badge text="v2.0"/>

## Overview

For taking photos, there are two types:

## Simple Type

<img alt="The Image of The Simple Camera" src="/images/expand/sensors/GVCameraBlock0.webp" class="center_image small">

Input the ID of the memory bank that you want to store the photo in, and the camera will take a photo towards the direction that block faces to. The view angle is 90 degrees, and the resolution is 512√ó512.

> The final input is generated by performing a bitwise OR operation between the inputs from all ports.

## Complex Type

You can control all parameters of the camera. The Details are below.
