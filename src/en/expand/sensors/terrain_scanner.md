# Terrain Scanner <Badge text="v2.0"/>

## Overview

Scans the blocks parallel to the face of the scanner, and stores the result to the specified memory bank. You can adjust the start distance and range.

> [!WARNING] âš  Attention
> If the scanning succeeds, the original data in the memory bank will be overwritten!
