# Terrain Stratum Display <Badge text="v1.0" type="info"/>

## Overview

For showing terrain strata, there are two types:

## Simple Type

<img alt="The Image of The Simple Terrain Stratum Display" src="/images/expand/leds/terrain_display_led_0.webp" class="center_image small">

Input the ID of the memory bank contains the terrain stratum data you want to display, and the terrain stratum will be displayed on the surface of the Simple Terrain Stratum Display. The brightness of the terrain stratum is decided by the environment brightness.

> The final input is generated by performing a bitwise OR operation between the inputs from all ports.

> [!TIP] üí° Tip
> You can use a [Terrain Scanner](../sensors/terrain_scanner) to import terrain stratum data into a memory bank.

## Complex Type

You can control all parameters of the floating terrain stratum. The Details are below.
