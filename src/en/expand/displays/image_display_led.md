# Image Display <Badge text="v1.0" type="info"/>

## Overview

For showing images, there are two types:

## Simple Type

<img alt="The Image of The Simple Image Display" src="/images/expand/leds/image_display_led_0.webp" class="center_image small">

Input the ID of the memory bank contains the image you want to display, and the image will be displayed on the surface of the Simple Image Display. The brightness of the image is decided by the environment brightness.

> The final input is generated by performing a bitwise OR operation between the inputs from all ports.

> [!TIP] 💡 Tip
> You can use the import function of memory bank, or a [Camera](../sensors/camera), or a [Player Monitor](../sensors/player_monitor) to import image data into a memory bank.

## Complex Type

You can control all parameters of the floating image. The Details are below.

### Ports Definition

<ElectricElement imgAltPrefix="The Complex Image Display" :connections="connections" imgSrc="/images/expand/leds/image_display_led_1.webp" :titleLevel="4"/>

> [!INFO] 💡 Tip
> The offset ranges of each direction are all ±4095.875.

> [!TIP] 📝 ABGR Color Mode
> From high to low bits，every 8 bits represents the color's <span style="opacity:0.6;">Alpha chanel</span>、<span style="color:blue;">Blue chanel</span>、<span style="color:green;">Green chanel</span>、<span style="color:red;">Red chanel</span>. You can use the tool below to convert.
