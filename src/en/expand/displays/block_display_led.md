# Block Show Board <Badge text="v1.0" type="info"/>

## Overview

For showing blocks, there are two types:

## Simple Type

<img alt="The Image of The Simple Block Show Board" src="/images/expand/leds/block_display_led_0.webp" class="center_image small">

Input the value of the block you want to display, and a floating 3D block will be displayed in front of the Simple Block Show Board. The other parameters:

* **Rotation**ÔºöDecided by the facing direction of the Block Show Board and the`In Hand Rotation`property of the block.
* **Scale Size**ÔºöDecided by the`In Hand Scale`property of the block.
* **Brightness**ÔºöDecided by the environment brightness.
* **Color**ÔºöNo change.

> The final input is generated by performing a bitwise OR operation between the inputs from all ports.

> [!TIP] üí° Tip
> You can get block value through [Block Value Plate](../sensors/block_value_plate), [Terrain Raycast Detector](../sensors/terrain_raycast_detector) etc.

## Complex Type

You can control all parameters of the floating block. The Details are below.
