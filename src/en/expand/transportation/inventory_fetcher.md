# Inventory Fetcher <Badge text="v2.0"/>

## Overview

You can use it to fetch items stored in the inventory of a block like a chest, furnace, and dispenser. When the input voltages change, it will try to fetch the items.

> The final input is generated by performing a bitwise OR operation between the inputs from all ports.

The shape of this element is T-shaped. The back of the horizontal line should connect to a block that stores items. The front of the vertical line has four situations:

1. If a block that can store items, the element will store the fetched items into it.
2. If one or several [extension poles](#about-extension-pole), the fetched items will be transported to the other side of the poles, then stored into a block that can store items, or dispense the items.
3. If an inventory fetcher with an opposite direction, and a block that can store items is behind the opposite inventory fetcher, the opposite inventory fetcher will be considered as an extension pole. (There can be more extension poles between them.)
4. Not the situations above, the fetcher will try to dispense the fetched items.

It has two types:

## Specify Content Type

## About Extension Pole

For the inventory fetcher to be able to transport items to a farther place with no delay. It is bidirectional. But they cannot intersect each other at right angles.
