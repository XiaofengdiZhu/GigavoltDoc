# Tractor Beam <Badge text="v2.0"/>

## Overview

Can convert several floating blocks into a`Subterrain`, then you can move, rotate and scale the subterrain. If the caught blocks contain a working tractor beam, the nested tractor beam still can work in the subterrain. The nest time is not limited.  
The`Subterrains`work in different subspaces, only the Gigavolt elements can work normally. What you see in the game is just their projections, so you cannot interact with the blocks in subterrains directly (including clicking, collision, shooting, explosion). For now version, there are three ways to interact with them:

* [Jump Wire](../wires/jump_wire)
* [Remote Controller](../others/remote_controller)
* Sensors:
    * Motion Detectorï¼šDetects motion in the main world only.
    * Photodiodeï¼šDetects light intensity in the main world only.
    * [Camera](../sensors/camera)ï¼šTakes photos that include the main world and subterrains.

> [!CAUTION] ðŸš¨ Important Warning
> When you exit the game, if the caught blocks in subterrains are not released back to the main world, they will disappear and cannot be recovered.

Other explanations:

* **Blocks will not be caught**ï¼šAir, bedrock, fire.
* **[Terrain Raycast Detector](../sensors/terrain_raycast_detector) & [terrain scanner](../sensors/terrain_scanner)**ï¼šIf they are in the main world, they can only detect/scan the blocks in the main world. If they are in subterrain, they can only detect/scan the blocks in the subterrain.
* **Various piston**ï¼šIf they are in the main world, they can only push and pull the blocks in the main world. If they are in subterrain, they can only push and pull the blocks in the subterrain, and a render bug hard to fix will occur.
* **Blocks can store items**ï¼šSuch as chest, dispenser, etc. Because of the game mechanics, they will drop the items stored in them when caught, and they cannot be used in subterrains. In addition, various signs cannot be used in subterrains either.
