## Crusher

破坏投掷后碰到的方块（须确实碰到）Crush what it hits when it is thrown or shot (Hitting actually is necessary).

If you use dispenser in this mod to shoot it and enable the option of "Ignore Gravity" or "Ignore Resistance", it can crush non-cube blocks (Hitting actually is still necessary).  
And if you use [Guided Dispenser](guided_dispenser) to shoot it, when it arrives at the destination, even if it does not hit a block, it will still crush the block at the destination.

## Interactor

Similar to [Crusher](#crusher), but the effect is to interact with the block.

## Block Data Modifier

Similar to [Crusher](#crusher), but the effect is to modify the data of the block to the data of the projectile. You need to edit the data of it before using it.
