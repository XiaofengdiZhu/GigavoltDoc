# Sign <Badge text="v1.0" type="info"/>

## Overview

Can not only display text on it and popup message, but can also display text floating in air. The disadvantage is that it can only record one line of text.

## Ports Definition

> Besides the back port and the 28th bit at bottom port, all operations are for the floating text
