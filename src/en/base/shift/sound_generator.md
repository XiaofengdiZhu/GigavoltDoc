# Sound Generator <Badge text="v1.0" type="info"/>

## Overview

Plays PCM-encoded audio data from a memory bank.

## Ports Definition

<ElectricElement imgAltPrefix="GV Sound Generator" :connections="connections" imgSrc="/images/base/shift/GVSoundGeneratorBlock.webp"/>

## Audio Convert

Before using the sound generator, you need to use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) or [Format Factory](http://www.pcgeshi.com/index.html) to convert the audio file to a file that meets the following requirements:

* File Format: WAV
* Codecï¼šPCM (If there is no such option, it is usually PCM)
* Channelsï¼š2
* Sample Rateï¼š8000 \~ 48000 Hz
* Bit Depthï¼š16 bits

After converting, import it to the Gigavolt Memory Bank.

> [!TIP] ðŸ’¡ If errors occupies when entering worlds.
> This is because other elements on ports have not been initialized, and this cause the sound generator receives 0V input. Or because the memory bank has not been initialized, then the sound generator try to read it but failed.  
> The correct solution is to set the input voltage of the backend to 0V before exiting the world, and then set it again when you need to play.
