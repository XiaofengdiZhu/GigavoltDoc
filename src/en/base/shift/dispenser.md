# Dispenser <Badge text="v1.0" type="info"/>

## Overview

Stores items in a similar way to a chest,but allows shooting or dispensing them through the hole when the input voltage changes. You can control the speed, angle, etc. of the projectile through the input voltage. By default, it is in shooting mode.

## Ports Definition

> The final input is generated by performing a bitwise OR operation between the inputs from all sides.
